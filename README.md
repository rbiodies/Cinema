# Cinema
The objective of this project is to develop a web application prototype using the **Spring** stack and
master **Hibernate** framework.

**MVC** (Model, View, Controller) is a classic web application design model.

[JSP](https://github.com/rbiodies/FWA/tree/main/ex02/Cinema/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp) is made for Web pages, [FTL](https://github.com/rbiodies/Cinema/tree/master/ex02/Cinema/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views) is a more generic templating language - it can be used to generate html, plain text, emails, etc.

The **jQuery** library has a full suite of **Ajax** (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh.

**WebSocket** is a thin, lightweight layer above TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This makes it suitable for using “subprotocols” to embed messages. **STOMP** (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) is a subprotocol operating on top of the lower-level WebSocket.
